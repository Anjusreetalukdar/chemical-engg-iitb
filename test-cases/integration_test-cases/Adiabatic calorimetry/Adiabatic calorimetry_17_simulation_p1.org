* Objective
  - To simulate the "Adiabatic calorimetry" experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/chemical-engg-iitb/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Adiabatic calorimetry/Adiabatic calorimetry_01_Usability_smk.org][Adiabatic calorimetry_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Click on the simulator link 
  4. A new tab will be opened with simulation proces
  5. Click on the start button as time varies temperature,voltage and current values varies and click on the next button.
  6. Enter calorimeter value and click on submit answer button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. A simulator link should be present
  3. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters the 
  4. Result should be displayed on the screen

* Review/comments
