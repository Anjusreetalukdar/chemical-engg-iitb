* Objective
  - To run the simulation of "Adiabatic calorimetry" experiment with invalid inputs

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/chemical-engg-iitb/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Adiabatic calorimetry/Adiabatic calorimetry_01_Usability_smk.org][Adiabatic calorimetry_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Click on the simulator link 
  4. a new tab will be opened with simulation proces
  5. Don't enter  temperature,voltage and current values in the respective fields and click on the next button.
  6. Don't enter calorimeter value and click on submit answer button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. A simulator link should be present
  3. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters the 
  4. An error message should be displays on the screen as to enter the input values.
