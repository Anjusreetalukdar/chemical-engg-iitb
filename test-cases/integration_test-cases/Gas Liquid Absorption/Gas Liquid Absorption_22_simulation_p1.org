* Objective
  - To simulate the Gas Liquid Absorption experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/chemical-engg-iitb/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Gas Liquid Absorption/Gas Liquid Absorption_01_Usability_smk.org][Gas Liquid Absorption_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Click on the simulator link 
  4. A new tab will be opened with simulation process
  5. Don't enter the values in the respective fields and click on submit button.
  6. Click on proceed to iteration and click on add phenolpthalene it replaces withperform titration, click on it
  7. Enter the values in the 1st titration field and click on perform 2nd titration
  8. Click on add methyl orange and click on proceed titration, enter the values in the field and click on proceed to bubble pot titration
  9. Repeat 6,7,8 steps again 
  10. Enter the value in the column field and bubbleport field and click on the check button.
  11. Click on Home ,Restart and buttons to perform the simulation again

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. A simulator link should be present
  3. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters the 
  4. An error message should be displayed on the screen as to enter the respective fields

* Review/comments
