* Test Steps
  1. Click on the simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Click on the simulator link 
  4. a new tab will be opened with simulation process
  5. Click on next button and give the invalid inputs in the respective fields by giving the values from keyboard  click on next button.
  6. Enter the invalid inputs in the pressure drop field and click on check button and click on next button
  7. Enter the invalid inputs in the coefficient field using the scroll bar and click on the submit button
