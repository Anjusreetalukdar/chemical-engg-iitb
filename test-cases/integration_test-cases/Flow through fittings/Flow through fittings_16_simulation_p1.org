* Objective
  - To run the simulation of "Flow through fittings" experiment with invalid inputs

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/chemical-engg-iitb/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Flow through fittings/Flow through fittings_01_Usability_smk.org][Flow through fittings_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Click on the simulator link 
  4. A new tab will be opened with simulation proces
  5. Select value,type ,density,viscosity from the drop down list and enter the pipe dia and length values and click on the next button
  6. Click on the next button and click on the start button as time varies percentage value also changes and click on next button
  7. Enter the values of volume ,time , friction, reynolds no andpipe roughness using the keyboard and click on next button.
  8. Enter experimental and pressure drop values and click on the percentage calculator and click on the next button
  9. Click on the restart ,end ,return to simulate the4 experiment again

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. A simulator link should be present
  3. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters the 
  4. Percentage error value should be displayed in the respective field. 
  5. Result should be displayed on the screen
  6. It should redirect to the intial page.
