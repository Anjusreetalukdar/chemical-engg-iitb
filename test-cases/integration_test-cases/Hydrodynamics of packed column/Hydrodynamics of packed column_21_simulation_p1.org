* Objective
  - To run the simulation of "Hydrodynamics of packed column" experiment with invalid inputs

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/chemical-engg-iitb/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Hydrodynamics of packed column/Hydrodynamics of packed column_01_Usability_smk.org][Hydrodynamics of packed column_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. "1.Click on the simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Click on the simulator link 
  4. A new tab will be opened with simulation process
  5. Select the package type using the keyboard and enter the values of pipe diameter,height,operating pressure and click on the submit button
  6. Don't give the values in the respective fields using the keyboard and click on the submit button
  7. Don't enter the velocity value and click on the check button.
  8. Don't enter the gas flooding and loading points and click on the check or next button
  9. Click on the end or home button"

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. A simulator link should be present
  3. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters the 
  4. An error message should be displays on the screen
  5. It should redirects to the home page

* Review/comments
