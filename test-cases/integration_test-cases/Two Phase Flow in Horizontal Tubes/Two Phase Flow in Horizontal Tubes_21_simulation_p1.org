* Objective
  - To run the simulation of "Two Phase Flow in Horizontal Tubes" experiment with invalid inputs

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/chemical-engg-iitb/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Two Phase Flow in Horizontal Tubes/Two Phase Flow in Horizontal Tubes_01_Usability_smk.org][Two Phase Flow in Horizontal Tubes_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. "1.Click on the simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Click on the simulator link 
  4. A new tab will be opened with simulation process
  5. Select the pipe dia value using the keyboard and enter invalid data in the pipe len field and click on submit button 
  6. Give the invalid inputs using the keyboard in the respective fields and click on submit button
  7. Click on start button as time varies volume value changes and click on next button
  8. Select a pattern from the drop down list and click on the submit button.
  9. Enter GG values,GL values and select the flow pattern from the drop down list and click on the submit button"

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. A simulator link should be present
  3. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters 
  4. An error message should be displays on the screen

* Review/comments
