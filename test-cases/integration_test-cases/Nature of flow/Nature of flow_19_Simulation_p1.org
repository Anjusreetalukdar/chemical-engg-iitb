* Objective
  - To simulate the "Nature of flow" experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/chemical-engg-iitb/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Nature of flow/Nature of flow_01_Usability_smk.org][Nature of flow_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Click on the simulator link 
  4. A new tab will be opened with simulation process
  5. Select the pipe diameter value from the drop down list and enter the pipe length value and click on the submit button and click on the next button
  6. Give the position value using the scroll bar and click on the next button
  7. Check the appropriate option and click on the next button
  8. Click on the start button as the time varies volume also changes , click on the stop button and click on the next button
  9. Check the appropriate option for the dimension sand enter the values for reynolds no and friction factor  and then click on the next button
  10. click on the restart button to restart the simulation process

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. A simulator link should be present
  3. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters the 
  4. Result should be displayed on the screen
  5. it should redirect to the intial page.
