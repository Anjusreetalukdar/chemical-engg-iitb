* Objective
  - To run the simulation of "Heat transfer in a double pipe heat exchanger" experiment with invalid inputs

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/chemical-engg-iitb/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Heat transfer in a double pipe heat exchanger/Heat transfer in a double pipe heat exchanger_01_Usability_smk.org][Heat transfer in a double pipe heat exchanger_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Click on the simulator link 
  4. A new tab will be opened with simulation proces
  5. Give the invalid inputs in the respective fields either by scrolling the bar or by typing the values and press enter or Click submit button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. A simulator link should be present
  3. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters the 
  4. An error message should be displays on the screen

* Review/comments
