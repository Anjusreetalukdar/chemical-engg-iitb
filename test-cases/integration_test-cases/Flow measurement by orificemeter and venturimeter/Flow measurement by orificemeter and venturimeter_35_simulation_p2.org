* Objective
  - To simulate the Flow measurement by orificemeter and venturimeter experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/chemical-engg-iitb/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Flow measurement by orificemeter and venturimeter/Flow measurement by orificemeter and venturimeter_01_Usability_smk.org][Flow measurement by orificemeter and venturimeter_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Click on the simulator link 
  4. A new tab will be opened with simulation process
  5. Click on next button and give the valid inputs in the respective fields by scrolling the bar and click on reset button.

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. A simulator link should be present
  3. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters the 
  4. The  inputs values  in the respective fields should be removed
