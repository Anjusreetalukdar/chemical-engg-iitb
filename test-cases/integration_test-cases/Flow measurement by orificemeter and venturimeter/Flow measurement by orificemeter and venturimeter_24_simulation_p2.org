* Objective
  - To simulate the Flow measurement by orificemeter and venturimeter experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/chemical-engg-iitb/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Flow measurement by orificemeter and venturimeter/Flow measurement by orificemeter and venturimeter_01_Usability_smk.org][Flow measurement by orificemeter and venturimeter_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Click on the simulator link 
  4. A new tab will be opened with simulation process
  5. Click on next button and give the valid inputs in the respective fields by scrolling the bar and click on next button.
  6. Don't enter the  values in the pressure drop field and click on check button and click on next button
  7. Don't enter the  value in the coefficient field using the scroll bar and click on the submit button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. A simulator link should be present
  3. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters the 
  4. An error message should be displayed on the screen as to enter the respective fields
